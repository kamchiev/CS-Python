1 Least square method ==> only for full rank matrix
A = [ ...]
b = [...]
rk = rank(A)
[Q,R] = qr(A)
Rt = R(1:rk,1:rk)
c = Q'*b
x_star = Rt/c1 (solution of the matrix)

2 LU
3 QR
4 Power method
5 Inverse power method
6 USV
7. Chebyshev-Lobatto
8.Cholenskiy (for symmetric and positive definite matrices; returns upper triangular matrix)
R=chol(A)
y=R'\b
x=R\y
